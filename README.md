My pet project where I learn building a complete web service with the architecture consisting of 3 united parts:
- **PostgreSQL** database *as a Docker container;*
- backend application based on the **Flask** framework *as a Docker container;*
- UI application based on the **React** framework *as a Docker container;*

which interact with each other with the assistance of **Nginx**.

The web service itself is a website showing interesting football statistics for matches/tournaments added to the database.
